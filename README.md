# Ocular-Disease-Classification

What we did?
Train and fine-tune the CNN models using relevant datasets containing labelled images of normal and diseased eyes. The datasets will be pre-processed to ensure data quality and consistency. Then employ transfer learning techniques by leveraging pre-trained CNN architectures, such as VGG16 or ResNet, to expedite the training process and improve model performance.

Datase?
In the project, Kaggle is utilized to acquire the 'Ocular Disease Recognition (ODIR5K)' dataset and the 'Glaucoma' dataset.
